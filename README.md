Healthy living 

1 I was not teeling very well so the doctor checked my heart and said I needed more exercise. I have never been very active, and I do not like sports.I have always wanted a pet, so my parents gave me a dog for my birthday. Now I get exercise by taking him for a walk every day. I have had him for three months now and I feel really healthy. Anna

Our teacher is the coach, and she also takes part in the training with us. She is in excellent condition too. Wang Wei 

3 For the last few years, I went to work on the underground. When I got to work , I always felt very sleepy and wis not happy. I bought a bike . Since then, it has become the art of my life. Now I ride to work every day. It is my daily exercise. I arrive at work with a smile on my face, Thomas 

4 I was weak after a long illness. So wanted to exercise more. Then friend suggested, "Why don't we go for a run before school?" So we started running a week ago. But I do not enjoy running, and when I get to school, I feel awful. My lers hurt and I am hot all over. Perhaps I am too weak to do any exercise. What do you think?-Richard
