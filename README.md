Doctor: How can I help you?

Daming: I feel ill. I've got a stomach ache and my head hurts.

Doctor: How long have you been like this?

Daming: Since Friday. I've been ill for about three days!

Doctor: I see. Have you caught a cold?

Daming: I don't think so.

Doctor: Let me take your temperature.. Hmm, there's no fever. What kind of food do you eat?

Daming: Usually fast food.

Doctor: Do you have breakfast?

Daming: No, not usually.

Doctor: That's the problem! Fast food and no breakfast. That's why you've got a stomach ache.

Daming: What about the headache?

Doctor: Do you do any exercise?

Daming: Not really. I haven't done much exercise since I got my computer last year.

Doctor: You spend too much time in front of the computer. It can be very harmful to your health.

Daming: OK, so what should I do?

Doctor: Well, don't worry. It's not serious. First, stop eating fast food and have breakfast every day. Second, get some exercise, such as running. And I'll give you some medicine. Take it three times a day.

Daming: Thank you, doctor.
