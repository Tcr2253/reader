Hi Lingling,

Thanks for your last message. It was great to hear from you, and I can't wait to meet you.

I hope you will know me from my photo when I arrive at the airport. I'm quite tall, with short fair hair, and I wear glasses. I'll wear jeans and a T-shirt for the journey, but I'll also carry my warm coat. I've got your photo- you look very pretty. I'm sure we'll find each other!

Thanks for telling me about your hobbies. You sound just like me! I spend a lot of time playing classical music with my friends at school, but I also like dance music- I love dancing! I enjoy sports as well, especially tennis. My brother is in the school tennis team- I'm very proud of him! He's good at everything, but I'm not. Sometimes I get bad marks at school, and I feel sad. I should work harder.

You asked me," How do you feel about coming to China?" Well, I often feel a bit sad at first when I leave my mum and dad for a few days, and I'm quite shy when I'm with strangers. I feel nervous when I speak Chinese, but I'll be fine in

a few days. I'm always sorry when I don't know how to do things in the right way, so please help me when I'm with you in China! Oh, I'm afraid of flying too.But I can't tell you how excited I am about going to China!

See you next week!

Love,

Sally
