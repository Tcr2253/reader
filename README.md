Ms James: This morning's class is about first aid, or giving someone basic medical help.Let's imagine an accident. A boy is lying at the bottom of the stairs. He isn't moving or making a sound. He is in pain. What can we do to help him?
Betty: First of all, find out what's wrong with him.
Ms James: How do we do that?
Betty: Ask him.
Ms James: OK. But he could have trouble hearing you or speaking to you.
Lingling: Shout for help? Call 120?
Ms James: Good idea, but what should we do before help arrives?
Tony: Make him comfortable.
Ms James: And how can we do that?
Tony: Lift him up and sit him on a chair?
Ms James: No, that could be harmful! You could drop him and hurt him even more. Betty, you must know!You did some basic medical training.
Betty: Make sure he's warm. Cover him with a coat.
Ms James: That's such good advice that you could be a doctor, Betty!
